# onos-ric-sdk-py
Python Application SDK for ONOS RIC (ÂµONOS Architecture)

## Description
This SDK contains two modules, E2 and SDL.

The SDK uses a sidecar proxy which implements the client side distributed system and load-balancing logic necessary to communicate to the RIC.

In addition, *onos_ric_sdk_py* creates an HTTP server for xApp configuration/ Developers can add their own endpoints to this server for their own application logic.

Have a look at **docs/index.rst**


### E2 module
The E2 module contains functions that interact with E2 nodes (**onos_api.e2t** python package). Apps can subscribe and unsubscribe to service models, and apps can send E2 control messages to make changes to E2 nodes. The E2 module interacts with the e2t node.

Methods of the class **E2Client**:
- control
  - Send a control message to the RIC to initiate or resume some functionality
    - it sends (RequestHeaders, ControlMessage) to the sidecar proxy
  - Args 
    - e2_node_id: The target E2 node ID.
    - service_model_name: The service model name
    - service_model_version: The service model version
    - **header: The RIC control header**
    - **message: The RIC control message**
- subscribe
  - Establish an E2 subscription
    - it sends (RequestHeaders, SubscriptionSpec(List[Action], EventTrigger)) to the sidecar proxy
  - Args
    - e2_node_id: The target E2 node ID
    - service_model_name: The service model name
    - service_model_version: The service model version
    - subscription_id: The ID to use for the subscription
    - **trigger: The event trigger**
    - **actions: A sequence of RIC service actions**
  - Yields
    - The next indication header and message, if available
- unsubscribe
  - Delete an E2 subscription
    - it sends (RequestHeaders, subscription_id) to the sidecar proxy
  - Args
    - e2_node_id: The target E2 node ID
    - service_model_name: The service model name
    - service_model_version: The service model version
    - subscription_id: The ID of the subscription to delete

Building Blocks: 
- grpclib.client as Channel to connect to sidecar proxy on localhost:5151 (-> this is done in the init method of the Class)
- onos_api.e2t for the sake of interaction
  - Action
  - ControlMessage
  - ControlServiceStub: built on top of grpclib.client as Channel
  - SubscriptionServiceStub: ~
  - Encoding: used in communication
  - EventTrigger: used in subscription definition
  - RequestHeaders: to sepcify details of the client
  - SubscriptionSpec: to sepcify actions and event triggers


### SDL module
The SDL module contains functions to get topology information from the RIC, for entities such as E2 nodes and cells (**onos_api.topo** python package). This module to also includes functions to read and write properties for E2 nodes and cells.

Methods of the class **E2Client**:
- get_cells
  - Get the cells corresponding to the given E2 node ID
    - it gets all the entities under src=e2_node_id with the raltion of CONTAINS and then include their aspects in a list if its kind is E2CELL
  - Args:
    - e2_node_id: The target E2 node ID
  - Returns:
    - A list of cells that belong to ``e2_node_id``
- _get_cell_entity_id
  - given e2_node_id and cell_global_id, returns entity id
    - same as get_cells, and also checks whether ascpects.cell_global_id == given cell_global_id
- get_cell_data
  - get data referenced by cell_id (cell_global_id)
    - it calls _get_cell_entity_id, and then gets the whole object by entity_id
- set_cell_data
  - set data referenced by key attached to a cell_id remove data referenced by key if data is None
- watch_e2_connections
  - Stream for newly available E2 node connections
    - it watches the topo component looking for the relation of CONTROLS and then loops over its aspects.serviceModels
      - 
  - Yields
    - An available E2 node and its ID.

Building Blocks: 
- grpclib.client as Channel to connect to sidecar proxy on localhost:5151 (-> this is done in the init method of the Class)
- onos_api.topo for the sake of interaction
  - TopoStub: as the endpoint
  - E2Cell: at the type in the get_cells return
  - E2Node: at the type in the watch_e2_connections return
  - Filter, Filters, RelationFilter, RanEntityKinds, RanRelationKinds: to choose between entities 
  - KpmRanFunction, MhoRanFunction, RcRanFunction, RsmRanFunction: diff service models available 


## How to use it
- define instances of **sdk.E2Client** and **sdk.SDLClient**
- watch for e2 nodes using **sdl_client.watch_e2_connections**
- run a function on the pair of **(sdk.E2Client, e2_node_id)**
  - subscribe on **e2_node_id**, **service_model_name**, **service_model_version**, **subscription_id**, **trigger**, **actions**
  - print the received header, message
